## Mini-Project: Dev Log

This project will allow participants to gain familiarity and comfort with coding in Ruby on Rails. Participants will also practice additional skills such as Git, SQL, SQLite, and using the UNIX Command Line.

#### Project Description

This project will allow you to create a Developer Blog, which you can use locally (on your computer only), or put online later for the whole Internet to see. This Blog should serve as a record for what you're learning as you learn it. Use it to store notes and other helpful resources for your reference later on.

#### Requirements

The following programs should be installed on your development environment:

- Git (v. 2.3.2+)
- Ruby (v. 2.0+)
- RubyGems (v. 2.4.5+)
- Rails (v. )
- SQLite (v. 3.8.5+)
- GitHub account ([sign up for a free account here](https://www.github.com/join))

You should also probably review these resources:

- [#HourofCode (Week 4, Winter 2015) - Setting up a UNIX on your computer](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hourofcode-at-southseattlecollege/WKWb85YrHqA)

#### Instructions

In this project, we will create a new Ruby on Rails (or "RoR") application from scratch.

##### Step 1: Verify Environment Setup

It's a good idea before you start to confirm what software is (and is not) installed on your primary programming computer (often referred to as your "development environment"). 

To do this, type the name of the program, followed by the "--version" tag. 

```
git --version
```
result --> git version 2.3.2 (Apple Git-55)

```
ruby --version
```
result --> ruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [universal.x86_64-darwin14]

```
gem --version
```
result --> 2.4.5

```
rails --version
```
result --> Rails 4.2.0

```
sqlite3 --version
```
result --> 3.8.5 2014-08-15 22:37:57 c8ade949d4a2eb3bba4702a4a0e17b405e9b6ace
