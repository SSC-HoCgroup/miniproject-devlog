## Mini-Project: Dev Log

This project will allow participants to gain familiarity and comfort with coding in Ruby on Rails. Participants will also practice additional skills such as Git, SQL, SQLite, and using the UNIX Command Line.

#### Project Description

This project will allow you to create a Developer Blog, which you can use locally (on your computer only), or put online later for the whole Internet to see. This Blog should serve as a record for what you're learning as you learn it. Use it to store notes and other helpful resources for your reference later on.

#### Requirements

The following programs should be installed on your development environment:

- [x] Ruby (v. 2.0+)
- [x] Git (v. 2.3.2+)
- [x] RubyGems (v. 2.4.5+)
- [x] SQLite3 (v. 3.8.5+)
- [x] GitHub account ([sign up for a free account here](www.github.com/join))

You should also probably review these resources:

- [x] [#HourofCode (Week 4, Winter 2015) - Setting up a UNIX on your computer](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hourofcode-at-southseattlecollege/WKWb85YrHqA)
